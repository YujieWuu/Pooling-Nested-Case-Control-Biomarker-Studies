We used restricted cubic spline functions to estimate a possible non-linear relationship between pooled biomarker measurements with disease risk in nested case-control studies.
We used Sandwich Variance Estimator to get an estimates of the coefficient variance, which can be used to test whether the non-linear relationshio exists.
